# Regression-Classification-Project

#Regression-Project
In this project, various regression methods including the ridge and lasso, GAMs, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and simple regression, are used on two different data sets: the health dataset and the real estate dataset. 
Different models are analyzed based on factors like MSE, p-value, and the correlation between different data parameters 

#Classification-Project
The classification project undertook a comprehensive assessment of various models to determine the most effective one based on minimal misclassification error and maximum accuracy
