# Regression-Project
Application of various statistical regression techniques for different datasets
In this project, various regression methods including the ridge and lasso, GAMs, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and simple regression, are used on two different data sets: the health dataset and the real estate dataset. 
Different models are analyzed based on factors like MSE, p-value, and the correlation between different data parameters
